# Blackjack Basic Strategy
A computer vision powered Blackjack basic strategy web-app powered by
[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com).

It runs a
[playing cards object detection model](https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/playing-cards-ow27d)
in your web browser with
[roboflow.js](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference/web-browser)
(which is backed by
[tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)). Simply point your camera at a
Blackjack hand, tell it what card the dealer has facing up, and it will tell you
what your optimal next move is based on
[basic strategy](http://www.blackjackcalculation.com/blackjack-great-basic-strat.png).
